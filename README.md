# Luminate

Luminate is a command-line wallet for [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/).

![luminate](luminate.png)

Stellar has [an excellent API](https://www.stellar.org/developers/reference/)
and [several excellent wallets](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/).
The goal of Luminate is to add to this ecosystem by providing a command line
wallet for users who do not want to install a full desktop application or trust a web service.

Because it is a command-line application, Luminate is simple, flexible, yet very
powerful. The code is a thin wrapper around [the Stellar
API](https://www.stellar.org/developers/reference/), which makes Luminate simple
and clean with a small code footprint. Luminate is easy to understand
at a glance and transparent enough to be easily customized and fully
trusted.
